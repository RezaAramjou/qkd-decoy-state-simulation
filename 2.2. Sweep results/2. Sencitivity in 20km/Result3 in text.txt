Of course. Here is a full, clean table summarizing the results from your sensitivity test at 20 km.

### Key Takeaways

* **Working System:** At 20 km, your system has a positive secure key length, which is a great baseline.
* **High Impact Vulnerabilities:** The system is extremely sensitive to high dark counts and optical misalignment, as both completely eliminated the secure key. A less efficient error correction protocol also significantly degraded performance.
* **Detector Blinding Anomaly:** The most interesting result is the "Detector Blinding" scenario. It caused a massive **1159% increase** in the calculated key rate. This correctly simulates a known attack where blinding the detectors can trick the system into overestimating its security. The very low p-value confirms this is a real, statistically significant effect.
